# **Predicto: Disease Prediction App**

## **Overview**

The Disease Prediction Application is a sophisticated web platform designed to utilize machine learning models for predicting various diseases based on user-uploaded data and images. This application leverages Flask for the web framework and TensorFlow for machine learning, offering reliable predictions for conditions such as diabetes, breast cancer, heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease, and COVID-19.

## **Features**

- **Disease Prediction**: Accurately predict multiple diseases using well-trained machine learning models.
- **Image Analysis**: Upload chest X-ray images for immediate COVID-19 prediction.
- **AI Medical Advisor**: Receive tailored medical advice generated by AI.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for seamless navigation and interaction.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras, Pickle
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV
- **APIs**: Google Generative AI for generating medical advice
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
